<h2>
    Summary
</h2>

<p>
    This here is my new portfolio. It was all made using HTML and CSS and took about a week to complete. It is still a work in progress, but eventually this portfolio will include all of my work as a web developer and audio engineer.

    The way I chose to approach this was simplicity. I wanted to keep things clean and minimal, yet smooth. Orange is my favorite color so I figured using a pastel version mixed with some opacity throughout the site would help accomplish that feeling.

    Content

    Within my portfolio, you will currently find stock images where future completed projects will go. You will also find videos of my past audio projects and eventually some links to music and podcasts. My contact information and a short bio are also found here.

    Challenges
</h2>

<pre>
    Admittedly, this project had numerous challenges that I encountered (and am still encountering). First of all, getting the format to sit where I wanted it to was a challenge within itself. It took a lot of time figuring out the best way to positions elements. I am actually still working changing up the layout of my app links.

    The biggest challenge was figuring out flexboxes and getting the page to fit correctly on all devices and screen sizes. For some reason, I wasn't able to get it right. Part of me really wantsto start over and figure out where I went wrong with flexboxes, but I will continue troubleshooting to see if I can get to the bottom of it.
